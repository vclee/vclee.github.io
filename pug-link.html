  <p>There are simply too many pets, with shelters already at capacity, and too few people consider adoption when looking for a companion. There are so many reasons why you should adopt, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Because you'll save a life</li>
    <li>Because you'll receive unconditional love</li>
    <li>Because it'll cost you less</li>
    <li>Because adoption helps more than just one animal</li>
  </ul>
